I'm an economic consultant with experience in management consulting and applied economic analysis, particularly in the context of mergers and competition. I enjoy working at the intersection of strategy, data, and policy — and occasionally write about spatial markets and industrial organization.

I previously worked at [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/) as a Business Analyst, and currently work in economic consulting.

# Hi, I'm Pradyumn Dayal

I'm an economic consultant with experience in management consulting and applied economic analysis, particularly in the context of mergers and competition. I enjoy working at the intersection of strategy, data, and policy — and occasionally write about spatial markets and industrial organization.

I previously worked at [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/) in New York as a Business Analyst, and currently work in economic consulting.

You can [email me](mailto:you@example.com) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com).

Hi, I’m Prady. I work in economic consulting, with experience in transfer pricing, antitrust, and applied market analysis. My work focuses on the intersection of economics, technology, competition, and policy.

Previously, I was a Business Analyst at McKinsey & Company and interned across strategy consulting, venture capital, and research roles. I’m interested in economic design, regulatory markets, and the economics of institutions and incentives.

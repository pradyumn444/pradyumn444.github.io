Hi, I’m Pradyumn Dayal — I work in economic consulting, with experience in antitrust, transfer pricing, and applied market analysis. My work often focuses on the intersection of economics, competition, and policy — including spatial analysis, enforcement, and platform markets.

Previously, I was a Business Analyst at McKinsey & Company and interned across strategy consulting, venture capital, and research roles. I’m interested in economic design, regulatory markets, and the economics of institutions and incentives.

You can reach me at [email](mailto:pradyumn.dayal@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pradyumn-dayal/).
